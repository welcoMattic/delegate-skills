# delegate-skills

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/amElnagdy/delegate-skills)](https://skills.sh/amElnagdy/delegate-skills)

Skills for **delegating coding work to a separate CLI agent and landing it yourself**. Your agent (the
orchestrator) writes a self-contained brief, hands it to an implementer CLI, then reviews the diff and
commits — staying the reviewer the whole way.

Five skills ship today: **`codex-delegate`** drives the OpenAI Codex CLI, **`opencode-delegate`**
drives the OpenCode CLI, **`agy-delegate`** drives the Google Antigravity CLI, **`grok-delegate`**
drives the Grok Build CLI, and **`kimi-delegate`** drives the Kimi Code CLI. Same loop, different
implementer.

## Install

Browse first:

```bash
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --list
```

Install the package, or just one skill:

```bash
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --skill codex-delegate
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --skill opencode-delegate
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --skill agy-delegate
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --skill grok-delegate
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --skill kimi-delegate
```

Install for a specific agent, or globally:

```bash
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --skill codex-delegate --agent claude-code
npx skills add amElnagdy/delegate-skills --global
```

Works with any orchestrating agent the [Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) supports.

## What it does

The loop:

1. **Write a brief** — a self-contained task spec; the implementer sees only what you send.
2. **Dispatch** it with the bundled `relay.mjs`.
3. **Wait** for completion — the helper writes a structured `result.json`.
4. **Review** the diff — re-run the project's gates yourself; pair with [guard skills](https://github.com/amElnagdy/guard-skills).
5. **Land** it — *you* commit, because committing belongs to the reviewer.

```text
Use $codex-delegate to have Codex implement the refactor in services/billing/, then review and commit it.
Use $codex-delegate to run this queue of migration tasks through Codex while I review each one.
Use $agy-delegate to have Antigravity implement the UI cleanup, then review and commit it.
Use $kimi-delegate to have Kimi implement the login-form refactor, then review and commit it.
```

## How this differs from the OpenAI Codex plugin

The official openai-codex Claude Code plugin is excellent and
**complementary** — this skill builds on the same `codex` CLI, it doesn't replace the plugin. They
point in different directions:

- The plugin's `codex:codex-rescue` agent is a **forwarder**: it hands one task to Codex and returns
  the output. It deliberately does not poll, review, or commit.
- The plugin's review command and stop-review gate run the **inverse** direction: **Codex reviews your work**.
- `codex-delegate` is the **orchestration loop in the other direction**: *you* drive Codex to
  implement across one task or a queue, and *you* review and land each result. That loop — brief →
  dispatch → poll → review → commit, with the orchestrator owning the commit — is what the plugin
  leaves to you, and what this skill encodes.

If you have the plugin installed, its companion CLI is an optional alternative dispatch backend; the
bundled `relay.mjs` is the default because it needs nothing but the `codex` binary.

## The skills

### codex-delegate

Drive the OpenAI Codex CLI as a background implementer: write the brief, dispatch via `relay.mjs`,
review the diff, commit it yourself. Ships four references (writing the brief, dispatch/poll, review/
land, multi-task queues) loaded only when needed, and one small helper script.

**You'll feel it when:** a bounded task — a migration, a mechanical refactor, a removal sweep — gets
handed to Codex, comes back as a clean diff with a structured report, and you commit it after re-running
the gates yourself instead of typing it all by hand.

### opencode-delegate

Drive the OpenCode CLI as a background implementer: write the brief, dispatch via `relay.mjs`, review
the diff, commit it yourself. Same four references and loop as `codex-delegate`. Autonomy is set by the
**agent** rather than a sandbox enum — `build` (write-capable) by default, `plan` (read-only) for
review/diagnosis — and the brief is piped to `opencode run` on stdin so multi-line XML briefs need no
quoting.

**You'll feel it when:** a bounded task gets handed to OpenCode, comes back as a clean diff with a
structured report and the run's cost, and you commit it after re-running the gates yourself.

### agy-delegate

Drive the Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`) as a background implementer: write the brief, dispatch via
`relay.mjs`, review the diff, commit it yourself. Same four references and loop as the other delegate
skills. Fresh runs start a new Antigravity project and explicitly add the target repo as the workspace;
Antigravity's permission bypass is opt-in, not the default.

**You'll feel it when:** a bounded task gets handed to Antigravity, comes back as a clean diff with a
structured report and a conversation id, and you commit it after re-running the gates yourself.

### grok-delegate

Drive the Grok Build CLI (`grok`) as a background implementer: write the brief, dispatch via
`relay.mjs`, review the diff, commit it yourself. Same four references and loop as the siblings.
Autonomy is set explicitly because Grok's default is `ask` (which would hang a headless pipe) —
default is `--always-approve --sandbox workspace`, `--read-only` uses `--sandbox read-only`, and
`--full-access` is the unrestricted opt-in.

**You'll feel it when:** a bounded task gets handed to Grok Build, comes back as a clean diff with a
structured report, and you commit it after re-running the gates yourself.

### kimi-delegate

Drive the Kimi Code CLI (`kimi`) as a background implementer: write the brief, dispatch via
`relay.mjs`, review the diff, and commit it yourself. Same four references and loop as the other
delegate skills. Headless Kimi always uses auto permission mode, so the relay passes no autonomy flags;
the child cwd pins the workspace, and `touchedFiles` shows what changed.

**You'll feel it when:** a bounded task gets handed to Kimi, comes back as a clean diff with a
structured report and session id, and you commit it after re-running the gates yourself.

### gemini-delegate

*Planned.* A delegate skill for the Gemini CLI, if and when it gains a comparable non-interactive mode.
Reserved so the umbrella can grow without a rename.

## Requirements

- For `codex-delegate`: the [`codex` CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authenticated
  (`codex login`).
- For `opencode-delegate`: the [`opencode` CLI](https://opencode.ai) installed and authenticated
  (`opencode auth login`).
- For `agy-delegate`: the [`agy` CLI](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/getting-started) installed
  and authenticated through Antigravity's first-launch setup.
- For `grok-delegate`: the [`grok` CLI](https://x.ai/cli) (Grok Build) installed and authenticated
  (`grok login`, or `XAI_API_KEY`; beta access needs an eligible xAI subscription).
- For `kimi-delegate`: the [`kimi` CLI](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/en/) installed via
  Homebrew (`brew install kimi-code`) or the official native installer, and authenticated via
  `kimi login`.
- Node 18+ and `git`.
- An orchestrating agent that can run shell commands and read files.
- Shell examples assume bash/zsh (macOS/Linux, or Git Bash/WSL on Windows).

## Trust and validation

This package is intentionally inspectable:

- All skill content is Markdown, plus exactly **one** executable per skill — each a `scripts/relay.mjs`.
- Each `relay.mjs` makes no network calls, reads or writes no credentials, sends no telemetry, and has
  no dependencies (Node built-ins only). It shells out only to its implementer CLI (`codex` /
  `opencode` / `agy` / `grok` / `kimi`) and `git`. That CLI authenticates exactly as you do at the
  terminal. Read the script before you run it.
- None of the relays ever commit — committing is always the orchestrator's job, after review.

**Verification status:** each relay's mechanics are verified — argument handling, exit codes,
`result.json`, resume, and implementer-specific guards. `opencode-delegate` requires `--model`, since
OpenCode has no safe default. `agy-delegate` is verified end-to-end on macOS against `agy` 1.0.16: a
headless `agy --print` run edits the working tree, the brief is delivered via `--print=` (never split
across argv), the workspace is pinned with an absolute `--add-dir`, and `result.json` carries the
conversation id and touched files; the pre-run brief-size guard and the resume/project
mutual-exclusion guards are exercised. `grok-delegate` is verified end-to-end on macOS against
**grok 0.2.101**: a headless run streams `--output-format streaming-json`, the relay reconstructs
`finalMessage` from the `text` events and the session id + token `usage` from the end event, default
autonomy (`--always-approve --sandbox workspace`) edits the working tree headlessly, and
`--resume-last` continues a prior session. **One caveat, confirmed by testing:** `--read-only` is
*best-effort*, not enforced — grok's read-only sandbox restricts out-of-workspace access, not its own
edit tool, so a headless run can still write the tree; the relay flags such runs with
`readOnlyViolation`, and the diff, not the flag, is the guarantee. Windows launch is pending a native
PowerShell/cmd smoke for both `agy-delegate` and `grok-delegate`. The full delegate → review → commit
loop is designed for and run on Claude Code but not yet formally verified end-to-end here. Other
orchestrators (Cursor, …) are designed-for but unproven. This line gets upgraded to "verified
end-to-end" with evidence, not assumption.

`kimi-delegate`'s relay mechanics are verified against `kimi` 0.24.0 on macOS (headless `-p` edit
run, stream-json parsing, `--session`/`--continue` resume, unavailable/127); Windows launch is pending
a native smoke.
